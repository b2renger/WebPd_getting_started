# WebPd getting started

This is a repo to get started with webpd and processing js 

in the patches_pd_webready : you'll find a few pd patches for doing stuff I hope it will be enough to start playing ! It's a small lib of pd synthetisers.

Sadly the documentation has been lost somewhere on a server. Hope to be able to get back to it someday.

check out the amazing webpd : https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd
and the amazing processing js : http://processingjs.org/
